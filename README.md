# Dictionary
A dictionary written in HTML and a little bit CSS and JS that you can fill with your own words you want to learn.

The disadvantage is that you need to add new words by adding new HTML tags. So it isn't automized well.

You can change colors (background, <dt> etc.) and you can see [here](https://user576g.github.io/Dictionary/) this varian of design. Black theme protects eyes =)
